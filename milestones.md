- Jose Antonio Alvarez Ocete  
	1. Working on the onion routing section for the client.
	2. Finish onion routing and mixnet. The noise addition will be also added if I have the time.
	3. Bytes/strings conversions in python is giving me some headaches. Not sure if this is because the encryption is wrong so I've been adding some basic tests to make sure those functionalities are okay.
